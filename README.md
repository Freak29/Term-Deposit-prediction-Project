# Term-deposit-Prediction-project
I have designed a Term deposit prediction system for banks using Data Science Algorithms as for which of the customers from the banks will be willing to take term deposits as Term deposits are a major source of income for a bank. A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term. The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing and digital marketing. Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns.  Hence, it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call.
I  used the following two files for the project & they contain the following

1. train.csv : The dataset to train the model. This file contains all clients and call details as well as the target variable “subscribed”. I have trained my model using this file.

 2. test.csv:  Using this trained model to predict whether a new set of clients will subscribe the term Deposit
